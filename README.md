You know when people say "Don't roll your own crypto"? For the sake of learning how cryptographic algorithms work, I'm going to blatantly ignore that rule and try to write as many cryptographic algorithms as I can from scratch. You should probably not consider actually using these in your application - consider yourself warned.

Quick note: this is not a cryptocurrency project; I have zero interest in cryptocurrencies.
